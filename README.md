Survival package for R
This is the source code for the "survival" package in R.  It gets posted to the comprehensive R archive (CRAN) at intervals, each such posting preceded a throrough test.  

The vignette "tutorial.Rnw" is not posted to CRAN, since it requires data from
the mstate package, survival is a recommended package, and such packages can 
only depend on other recommended packages.  (This allows for a consistent 
distribution bundle.)
