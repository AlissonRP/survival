model.matrix for tt() terms

look at printCoefmat

pyears with an I() term on the right hand side, "tform" is wrong.

update penalized models
terms for cox.zph, it also needs to ignore NA coefficients.
add design of the survival library document to vignettes

include.lowest for tcut (first find out what the issue is)

add "fun" to summary.survfit
 
Fixed: ?Surv claims that -Inf is allowed, but survreg chokes.

timefix for survdiff

confint method for coxph objects

deal with variables that have spaces, e.g.,  Surv(time, status) ~ `bad name`

Cook and Lawless, Multistate models for life history data, page 104, just above 
section 3.5.2.  State that  
  $\hat \theta - \hat\theta_{(i)} \approx V U_i$
where $V$ is the Cox model variance.
This is my formula for the dfbeta residuals.  Thay also state that
 $LD_i = 2(loglik(\theta) - loglik(\theta_{(i)}) = U'_i V U_i $

This appears to be Han Van H's likelihood displacement residual and would lead
to the cross-validated log-likelhood?   They are talking about parametric
models though.

tmerge doesn't like Date objects for the timeline.
